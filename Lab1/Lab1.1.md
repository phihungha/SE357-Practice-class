**What criteria should be used in choosing an appropriate requirements engineering tool?**

**Answer:**
- Requirements traceability mechanism
- Requirements analysis mechanism
- Security and accessibility mechanism
- Portability and compatibility
- Configuration management approach
- Communication and collaboration mechanism
- Change management support
- Online publishing support
- SRS documentation format
- Export/import with standard formats
- Training and learning curve effort
- Easily adapted and integrated into business processes
- Providing support for reuse

**Are there any drawbacks to using certain tools in requirements engineering activities?**

**Answer:**
- Complex to use and may require training for a long time
- Difficult to integrate with other parts of the project
- Licensing cost
- Data loss or corruption
- Lack of support for regulatory compliance
- May face lack of support or discontinuation
- Overemphasis on Tool over Process

**When selecting an open-source tool, what characteristics should you look for?**

**Answer:**
The same as paid RE tools but with these additions:
- Active development
- Good guides and training
- Good community support
- High adoption

**How can tools enable distributed, global requirements engineering activities? What are the drawbacks in this regard?**

**Answer:**
Many RE tools allow sharing of requirement artifacts and real-time collaboration across the globe. They allow hundreds of people worldwide to participate in RE activities at any time with efficiency. However, security, reliability, and regulatory compliance are common drawbacks.

**If an environment does not currently engage in solid requirements engineering practices, should tools be introduced?**

**Answer:**
No. Tools can only be effectively used when the team has already properly established and followed solid RE practices. Using tools alone without good practices may exacerbate problems.

**What sort of problems might you find through a traceability matrix that you might not see without one?**

**Answer:**
- Missing, incomplete requirements
- Contradictions
- Ambiguities
- Scope creep

**How is AI being proposed for knowledge acquisition and representation in requirements specifications?**

**Answer:**
- Use Natural Language Processing to analyze requirements from emails, user stories,...
- Prioritize requirements using past data
- Data analytics
- Recognize patterns in requirements to identify inconsistencies
- Generate initial requirements using domain knowledge and user stories
